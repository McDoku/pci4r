= pci4r
'pci4r' is a library of concepts covered in Toby Seagaran's "Programming
Collective Intelligence". The idea is not to slavishly port Toby's code,
but to provide the same tools in Ruby for others to use.

This code is brought to you by the following international conspirators:
  * Jesse Clark
  * Sandro Paganotti
  * Mike Mondragon
  * Alex Vollmer
  * Damiano Zanisi
